# RPS_JS

This is my sandbox repo for creating the Rock, Paper Scissors game using Javascript

Currently the core basic functionality is there, and I will eventually add:

    - Cleaner code / structure
    - More functionality
    - A GUI (inc. a basic landing page)

For the GUI, I'd like to add:

    - A button that starts the game
    - A visual score counter
    - Celebratory effects
    - More stylistic elements for the prompts/alerts

For the functionality: 

    - Maybe an overall game counter (i.e. Computer has won 3 games, you 0 etc)
